**Empowering developers with intelligent tools and streamlined workflows.**

Context Vibes is an open-source initiative dedicated to creating tools that enhance the developer experience, particularly by improving the interplay between developers, their projects, and AI assistants. We believe that providing the right context, in the right way, can significantly boost productivity, clarity, and the effectiveness of AI-augmented software development.

## Our Mission

Our core mission is to:
*   **Streamline Development:** Simplify and standardize common development tasks through intuitive and consistent tooling.
*   **Enhance AI Collaboration:** Build tools that generate rich, actionable context for AI assistants, making them more effective co-pilots.
*   **Foster Clarity:** Promote clear, structured communication from tools, benefiting both human understanding and machine parsing.
*   **Champion Open Source:** Develop and share our work openly, inviting community participation and collaboration.

## ‚ú® Our Projects

Currently, our flagship project is:

### Context Vibes CLI (`contextvibes/cli`)

[![Go Report Card](https://goreportcard.com/badge/github.com/contextvibes/cli)](https://goreportcard.com/report/github.com/contextvibes/cli)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT)

The **Context Vibes CLI** is a versatile command-line tool designed to act as a developer's assistant. It wraps common development operations (Git workflows, IaC, code quality, testing, etc.) with a strong focus on:

*   **Structured Terminal Output:** Clear, human-readable, and AI-parsable output.
*   **AI Context Generation:** Produces `contextvibes.md` files to feed context to LLMs.
*   **Detailed Trace Logging:** Separate, detailed JSON logs (`contextvibes_ai_trace.log`) for in-depth AI analysis or debugging.
*   **Configurability:** Project-specific settings via `.contextvibes.yaml` for tailored workflows.
